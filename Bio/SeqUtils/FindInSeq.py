class FindRepeats:
    """
    A class that is used to find and count all subsequences within the
    sequence. It creates the set of all possible subsequences and then
    uses it to count non-overlapping repeats of each subsequence in the set.
    Length of subsequences can be adjusted using `length` argument as
    described below. The output dictionary can be filtered by

    Args:
        - sequence (Seq object): The input sequence to search in.
        - length (int): The length of subsequences that are to be found. (default 3)
        - sort (str): Determines if and how (descending/ascending) `self.counts`
                      is to be sorted. It is sorted primarily by value and secondarily
                      by key in alphabetical order.
        - threshold (int): The minimum number of subsequence counts in
                           the sequence. Subsequences that have number
                           of counts below threshold will be filtered out
                           from the output dictionary. (default 0 -> no filtering)

    Attributes:
        - subseqs (set): The set of all possible subsequences of
                         `length == length`. Subsequences are searched for
                         in all reading frames which means they do overlap.
        - counts (dict): The dictionary containing the subsequences (keys) and
                         their counts (values). This dictionary can be filtered
                         using `threshold` argument or sorted using `sort` argument.

    Methods:
        `_find_all_subseqs(sequence: str, length: int) -> set:`
            Finds all possible subsequences of
            `length == length` in all reading frames.

        `_count_subseqs(sequence: str, subseqs: set, length: int, threshold: int) -> dict:`
            Finds number of appearances of all `subseqs` in `sequence`
            Creates a sorted (descending) and filtered
            (`value >= threshold`) `counts` dictionary.
